Lawnchair
===

A Lawnchair is sorta like a couch except smaller and outside. Perfect for HTML5 mobile apps that need a lightweight, adaptive, simple and elegant persistence solution. 


<pre>
    // Try it! Open Firebug or Web Inspector
    Lawnchair({name:'testing', adaptor:'dom'}, function(store) {
        // Create an object
        var me = {name:'brian'};
        // Save it
        store.save(me);
        // Access it later... Yes even after a page refresh!
        store
    })
</pre>

Key concepts
---

- Collections contains objects; or.. a lawnchair instance is really just an array of objects.
- Adaptive persistence. the underlying store is abstracted behind a consistent interface.
- Pluggable collection behavior. Sometimes we need collection helpers but not always.

By default, Lawnchair will persist using DOM Storage but if other
adapters are available and DOM Storage isn't supported by the currently
executing JavaScript runtime. Lawnchair will attempt each successive
adapter until it finds one that works. Easy.
