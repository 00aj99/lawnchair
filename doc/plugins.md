Plugins
===

Lawnchair deals in collections of json documents. Plugins augment lawnchair collections with particular behaviors.

    aggregation ... utilities for dealing with aggregate data; kinda happens with collecdtions
    callbacks ..... event hooks fired before/after any adapter method call
    pagination .... page collection data
    query ......... query collection data 

If you'd like to create a plugin there are some great ideas listed in the roadmap. ;)
