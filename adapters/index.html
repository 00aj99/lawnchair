<h1>Adapters</h1>

<p>Adapters expose a consistent interface to a persistent storage implementation. A Lawnchair build enqueues adapters and mixes in the first one valid for the current environment. This pattern is common in mobile scenarios, for example, a Lawnchair build with the DOM and Gears adapters will gracefully degrade through all available Android persistence solutions.</p>

<pre><code>blackberry-persistent-store ... great for phonegap
dom ........................... default adapter
gears-sqlite .................. for androids &lt; 2.x
ie-userdata ................... for msft js engines
memory ........................ in memory reference implemenation
webkit-sqlite ................. great for webkits
window-name ................... oldest hack in the book
</code></pre>

<p>If you require an adapter thats not listed here it is trivial to implement your own. Adapters must have the following interface:</p>

<pre><code>adapter ........................ adapter name 
valid .......................... true if the adapter is valid for the current environment
init ([options], callback) ..... ctor call and callback. 'name' is the most common option (to name the collection) 
keys (callback) ................ returns all the keys in the store
save (obj, callback) ........... save an object
batch(array, callback) ......... batch save an array of objects
get (key|array, callback) ...... retrieve an object (or array of objects) and apply callback to each 
exists (key, callback) ......... check if a document exists
all (callback) ................. returns all the objects to the callback as an array
remove (key|array, callback) ... remove a document or collection of documents
nuke (callback) ................ destroy all documents
</code></pre>

<p>The tests ensure adapters are consistent no matter what the underlying store is. If you are writing an adapter check out <code>./tests/lawnchair-spec.js</code>. The memory adaptor is probably the simplest implementation to learn from. Note, all Lawnchair methods accept a callback as a last parameter. This is deliberate, most modern clientside storages only have async style interfaces, for a good reason, your code won't block the main thread aiding in the perception of performance. That callback will be scoped to the lawnchair instance. Make use of <code>fn</code> and <code>lambda</code> methods to allow for terse callbacks. </p>
