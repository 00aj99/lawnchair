<ul>
	<li>micro tiny storage without the nasty SQL: pure and delicious JSON</li>
	<li>clean and simple oo design with one db table per store</li>
	<li>key/value store.. specifying a key is optional</li>
	<li>happily and handily will treat your store as an array of objects</li>

</ul>
<p></p>

<h4>Initialize a store</h4>

<p>Create a store. You can create as many as you like. If it doesn't exist Lawnchair creates a new store, otherwise, it just loads the store you name. It might be helpful to consider a store to be something akin to an array.</p>

<h4>Saving JSON documents</h4>

<p>Lawnchair stores JSON objects specifically. It assumes that each object has a property called <em>key</em>. Documents with a key that does not exist, or without a key, in the store are inserted into the store. Documents with a key that does exist in the store are simply updated. Lawnchair will generate a unique key for you if you don't supply one.</p>

<h4>Retrieving documents</h4>

<p>Your new friend Lawnchair isn't going to block you. Anything that could potentially be time consuming will be asynchronous. The only problem with async style coding is typing the word <em>function</em> all the time. Lawnchair has a nice terse shorthand syntax for that too.</p>

<h4>Removing documents</h4>	

<script src="http://gist.github.com/240460.js?file=remove.js"></script>


<h4>Iterators</h4>

<p>Lawnchair knows you'll likely be iterating over those documents and even provides helpers for searching and thus finding. This is further augmented by that nice shorthand syntax introduced earlier.</p>
